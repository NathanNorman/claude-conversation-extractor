# Test Suite Overview

## Current Status

✅ **Working Tests** (31 tests passing):
- Basic test infrastructure validation
- Date filter utilities (18 tests)
- Utility functions (6 tests)
- Basic environment tests (7 tests)

## Test Architecture Created

### 🏗️ Test Infrastructure
- **`utils/test-helpers.js`** - Comprehensive test utilities including:
  - Test environment creation
  - Mock readline/stdout for CLI testing
  - Console capture utilities
  - Mock Inquirer for menu testing
  - Performance timers

- **`utils/mock-factories.js`** - Data generation factories for:
  - Mock conversations
  - Mock search results
  - Mock configurations
  - Mock file systems
  - Mock JSONL files

- **`fixtures/conversation-fixtures.js`** - Pre-defined test data:
  - Sample conversations (simple, with tools, with MCP, etc.)
  - Search test cases with expected results
  - Export format test cases
  - CLI interaction scenarios
  - Error scenarios

### 📋 Test Suites Prepared

1. **Search Engine Tests** (`search/minisearch-engine.test.js`)
   - Index building and management
   - Search functionality (exact, fuzzy, boolean)
   - Performance testing
   - Error recovery

2. **Setup System Tests** (`setup/setup-system.test.js`)
   - Setup manager configuration
   - Bulk extraction
   - Index building
   - Setup menu interactions

3. **CLI Interaction Tests** (`cli/cli-interaction.test.js`)
   - Live search interface
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Menu interactions
   - Error handling

4. **Export Functionality Tests** (`export/export-functionality.test.js`)
   - Markdown export
   - JSON export
   - HTML export
   - Export manager
   - Bulk operations

5. **Integration Tests** (`integration/integration.test.js`)
   - Complete workflows
   - Multi-user scenarios
   - Error recovery
   - Real-world usage patterns

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all existing tests
npm test

# Run specific test categories
npm test -- tests/date-filters.test.js
npm test -- tests/utils.test.js

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

## Implementation Status

| Component | Tests Written | Implementation | Status |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Date Filters | ✅ 18 tests | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Passing |
| Utilities | ✅ 6 tests | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Passing |
| Search Engine | ✅ 40+ tests | ⏳ Partial | 🔧 Ready |
| Setup System | ✅ 30+ tests | ⏳ Partial | 🔧 Ready |
| CLI Interaction | ✅ 25+ tests | ⏳ Partial | 🔧 Ready |
| Export System | ✅ 35+ tests | ❌ Not implemented | 🔧 Ready |
| Integration | ✅ 20+ tests | ⏳ Partial | 🔧 Ready |

## Benefits of This Test Architecture

1. **Regression Prevention** - Any changes to existing functionality will be caught
2. **Reusable Components** - Test helpers and factories can be used across all tests
3. **Isolated Testing** - Each test runs in its own environment
4. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Tests cover unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios
5. **Easy Maintenance** - Clear structure and documentation

## Next Steps for Development

As you implement new features:

1. The test suite is ready - just implement the missing modules
2. Tests will guide the implementation (TDD approach)
3. Use the mock factories to generate test data
4. Run tests continuously during development
5. Update tests as requirements change

## Test-Driven Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Run tests to see what needs implementation
npm test -- tests/export/

# 2. Implement the feature
# (create src/export/markdown-exporter.js etc.)

# 3. Run tests again to verify
npm test -- tests/export/

# 4. Refactor with confidence
# Tests ensure nothing breaks
```

The comprehensive test suite is now in place to support ongoing development and ensure quality!
